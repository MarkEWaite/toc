# Jenkins Update

## Features and release

Jenkins continued its pattern of releasing a [new version](https://www.jenkins.io/changelog/) every week and a [new long term support version](https://www.jenkins.io/changelog-stable/) every 4 weeks.
New features are summarized in the [Jenkins tutorials playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvBBnHmZuNQJeznYL2F-MpZYBUeLIXYEe) on [CloudBees TV](https://www.youtube.com/@CloudBeesTV).

## Adoption updates

Jenkins controller installations reporting to the Jenkins statistics system varied during the last three months between 285 000 and 297 000.
Controller installation counts continue to remain relatively steady as they have for the last few years.

## Contribution trends

Jenkins has been accepted in [Google Summer of Code 2024](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects) for [5 projects](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2024/05/01/google-summer-of-code-congrats-and-welcome/).
The projects include:

* [Manage GitHub permissions as code](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2024/project-ideas/automating-rpu-for-jenkinsci-organization/)
* [Using OpenRewrite recipse for plugin modernization](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2024/project-ideas/using-openrewrite-recipes-for-plugin-modernization-or-automation-plugin-build-metadata-updates/)

Extra special thanks in advance to the contributors, Danyang Zhao, Sridhar Sivakumar, Shlomo Dahan, Nour Almulhem, and Phillipp Glanz.

The Jenkins project is also mentioned in other Google Summer of Code projects, including:

* [Ceph](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/SG1yEXSM) - 2 projects
* [Linux Foundation](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/dtZ1xm2i) - kworkflow testing improvements

The count of individual contributors to Jenkins decreased from a peak of 600 to 500 as reported by the [Linux Foundation DevStats project](https://jenkins.devstats.cd.foundation/d/7/companies-contributing-in-repository-groups?orgId=1).
This is a common pattern that we've seen each year during the transition from Google Summer of Code candidate evaluation to Google Summer of Code implementation.

## Infrastructure updates

The Jenkins infrastructure team meets weekly and shares the [meeting recordings and meeting notes](https://community.jenkins.io/tag/sig-infra) on the Jenkins community site.

Jenkins infrastructure cloud costs are spread between multiple donors, including:

* Continuous Delivery Foundation
* CloudBees Inc.
* Microsoft Azure
* AWS
* DigitalOcean

Cloud costs are tracked in detail by the Jenkins infrastructure team.
The year to date expenses are in budget and are planned to remain in budget for the rest of 2024.

## Fun facts

The Spring Security project has announced the [31 Aug 2024 end of life of Spring Security 5.8](https://spring.io/blog/2024/03/01/support-timeline-announcement-for-spring-framework-6-0-x-and-5-3-x) along with end of life of Spring Framework 5.3.
Spring Security 6 requires Java 17 and Jakarta EE 9.
The Jenkins project is preparing for its upgrade from Spring Security 5.8 to Spring Security 6 and for its upgrade to require Java 17 as the minimum Java version for Jenkins.
We expect to require Java 17 in Jenkins weekly before the end of June 2024 and to require Java 17 in the long term support release at the end of October 2024.
